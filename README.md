# Attibling

Attibling is a Ghost theme forked from [Liebling](https://github.com/eddiesigner/liebling) in which I added [Attila](https://github.com/zutrinken/attila)'s UI for the post part.

This theme was modified for the blog [GEEKLY](https://geekly.blog/) by [Alexis De Chiara](https://alexisdechiara.fr/) and is accessible for **free**, however, make sure you modify the elements presented in this README so as not to redirect to the blog.
